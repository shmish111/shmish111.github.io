I used to be happy.  I learned Java, then Spring, after that there was TDD and BDD, finally I started using ScalaTest.  Each of these steps made me a better developer, made my job more enjoyable and last but not least they made me more employable.  Then came functional programming.  At first it was difficult, trying weird flat map stuff in Scala, not knowing what the hell my colleagues were talking about, not really getting it.  But over a period of 3 months I feel like I had a revolution of the mind; Haskell and Clojure were reasonably easy to learn and understand, all the crazy ScalaZ stuff didn't look quite so crazy and I started to look at coding in a slightly different way.  I started to have heretical thoughts, perhaps Object Orientation isn't as good as it's made out to be, perhaps all these experienced programmers that I respect are missing something important, perhaps there is more to the world of software development than the JVM and .NET?
