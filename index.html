<p>Quality is more complicated than we often think and we would do well to dig deeper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of software engineering what is quality? Why do we care about it? How does it help us? When we think about “quality” we usually go straight to QA or “Quality Assurance” and from there we think of testing, however testing is just one small facet of quality. In reality, we might think that quality is about preventing bugs but we can go even further back to basics; why do we care about bugs?<br></div><a href="/2018/08/02/looking-at-quality/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2018/07/15/to-batch-or-not-to-batch/" class="post-title-link">To Batch Or Not To Batch</a></h2><div class="post-time">Jul 15, 2018</div><div class="post-content"><blockquote>

<p>In projects with lots of contributors and long running tests, it seems like common sense to batch features together in order to reduce the overhead of running the long tests. In this post I try to prove whether this is a valid thing to do.<br></div><a href="/2018/07/15/to-batch-or-not-to-batch/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/03/18/safe-json-with-haskell/" class="post-title-link">Safe JSON with Haskell</a></h2><div class="post-time">Mar 18, 2017</div><div class="post-content"><blockquote>

<p>Recently I’ve been working on an HTTP API written in Haskell. One of the things that tends to be much easier and nicer in dynamic languages is dealing with JSON in these APIs, statically typed languages tend to have lots of boilerplate. Not only is this boilerplate annoying to write but it can cause small changes to the API into a big task.</p>
<p>With Haskell (actually GHC) this is not the case.<br></div><a href="/2017/03/18/safe-json-with-haskell/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2016/05/14/the-repl-as-a-business-tool/" class="post-title-link">The REPL as a business tool</a></h2><div class="post-time">May 14, 2016</div><div class="post-content"><blockquote>

<p>The boundary between a business user and a developer can often be a big source of waste. Going back and forth between the user and your code to discover what data is really needed can really cause pain and waste a huge amount of time. The REPL can be used as an interactive environment to pair with a user and write the exact code required, first time.<br></div><a href="/2016/05/14/the-repl-as-a-business-tool/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2016/04/27/beating-bugs-with-brute-force/" class="post-title-link">Beating Bugs With Brute Force</a></h2><div class="post-time">Apr 27, 2016</div><div class="post-content"><blockquote>

<p>For years I’ve been writing the tests for the applications I write however it turns out that computers can do a better job.

<p>Recently I was asked to complete a small test for a job interview in the form of a Clojure program. The idea of the program was to take commands from stdin and use them to mess around with a ‘canvas’, basically a super-primitive graphics program. It occured to me that since part of this would involve parsing and validating commands and displaying any errors, it might be a good opportunity to use the Either monad and see the current state of monad libraries in Clojure.<br></div><a href="/2015/12/15/either-monad-or-exceptions/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2014/09/09/static-vs-dynamic/" class="post-title-link">Static vs Dynamic</a></h2><div class="post-time">Sep 9, 2014</div><div class="post-content"><p>I have recently moved jobs and now I am using Clojure rather than Java and Scala.

This approach encourages on-time delivery of features, a team only commits to what it thinks it can do based on previous iterations and it makes sure this is delivered.  If things got a bit close towards the end then in the next sprint they should commit to a bit less and visa versa.  This seems like a noble and pragmatic approach at first however there are some flaws, mostly due to human nature.<br></div><a href="/2014/06/24/the-trouble-with-scrum/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li></ul></section><footer><div class="paginator"><a href="/page/2/" class="next">PREVIOUS</a></div><div class="copyright"><p>© 2015 - 2018 <a href="http://shmish111.github.io">David Smith</a>, unless otherwise noted.</p></div></footer><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];e.src='//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));ga('create',"UA-52255315-1",'auto');ga('send','pageview');</script><script>var _hmt = _hmt || [];(function() {var hm = document.createElement("script");hm.src = "//hm.baidu.com/hm.js?a36e15d9e2adec9a21fcdd9f686b1ed2";var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(hm, s);})();</script><script src="https://cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.5.3/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script></body></html>
